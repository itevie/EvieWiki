# EvieWiki
An old Wikipedia clone - one of my first proper websites I made.

To run it, download it as ZIP, make sure you have Node.JS installed, run `npm install`, then `node index.js` and you're done.
Thought make sure you add a mongo key somewhere.

Or, try the website at [EvieWiki website](https://eviewiki.repl.co)
